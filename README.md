## Notes from the Developeer 
    - 3/29: Saving a favorite currently saves a string of the name and country. I will either need to save the lat and lon or a state code as well to correctly redisplay the same location. 
        - Responsivness would use some work at the smaller mobile sizes
    
## Peer Reviewer: Caleb Sylvia
## Review: Site is super simple and clean, I really enjoy all the colors and the simplicity of the app. One thing is the little black bar that is on the bottom, I don't know if that is from margin or padding or if its supposed to be there but that is probably the only thing I can say is off. Great Job!





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel
